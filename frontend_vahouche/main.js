      "In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.<br />\r\nNext, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Deluxe edition contains the basic Taluva game at increased size.<br />",

      "   Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road   is a tense economic game charting the rise and fall of the greatest city in the world. \r\n In  Merv , players are vying to amass power and wealth in the prosperous heart of the Silk Road. Through careful court intrigue, timely donations to the grand mosque, and favorable trade deals, players attempt to redirect as much of that prosperity as possible into their own pockets. \r\n Meanwhile, beyond the city walls Mongol hordes approach. If you help construct the city walls, you give up on precious opportunities to build up your own stature, but leave it unprotected and you will burn with the city. Every decision is weighty and the consequences of each misstep are dire. Will you rise to prominence or fade into oblivion? ",

      "<p>Find adventure in this marvelous asymmetric game. Root provides limitless replay value as you and your friends explore the unique factions all wanting to rule a fantastic forest kingdom. Play as the Marquise de Cat and dominate the woods, extracting its riches and policing its inhabitants, as the Woodland Alliance, gathering supporters and coordinate revolts against the ruling regime, the Eyrie Dynasties, regaining control of the woods while keeping your squabbling court at bay, or as the Vagabond, seeking fame and fortune as you forge alliances and rivalries with the other players. Each faction has its own play style and paths to victory, providing an immersive game experience you will want to play again and again.</p>",
    commentary:
      "<p>During a car ride, designer Cole and his wife were listening to an audio book of T. H. White's <strong>The Once and Future King</strong>. When the Monarch of Moat delivered the following line to Arthur, it spawned a series of ideas creating the framework for Root, a game of Might and Right: &quot;...There is only power. Power is of the individual mind, but the mind's power is not enough. Power of the body decides everything in the end, and only Might is Right.&quot;</p>",
    faq: '<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\n<p>According to the official rules, your group determines the starting player and seating order randomly (Rule 5.1.1). After the starting player finishes their turn, the next clockwise player begins their turn (Rule 1.5). A common house (unofficial) rule among fans is to have the Marquise (Cat) faction start the game especially at 4 or more player counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this a good 2-player game?</strong></p>\n<p>While some may still enjoy the 2-player gameplay (and I am one of them), it\'s not the ideal player count due to limited number of viable faction combinations. Every faction has an assigned "Reach Value" that represents the amount of influence they can have over the board state, and Leder Games recommends that the total Reach Value should equal or exceed the minimum indicated for the player count (see table below). For example, for 2-player gameplay using the base game, the only viable factions are Marquise and Eyrie.</p>\n<p><img class="w-50" src="https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/userfiles/1613783703105-root%20faction%20reach%20values.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p>If you want to have a fuller experience at a 2-player count, here are some options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get <a class="game-preview" href="/game/AMEwdJGV5c/root-the-clockwork-expansion" data-tipped-options="ajax: {data: { ids: \'AMEwdJGV5c\', client_id: \'W0AQGbjlZE\' }}">Root: The Clockwork Expansion</a> - Adds simulated opponent(s).
